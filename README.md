# Squid Pro Quo - 9.2 Fullstack Portfolio Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## NOTE

Please be sure to install all dependencies by running `npm i` once you fork and clone this repo.

## Description

This project was a chance to apply the frontend and backend skills I've developed in program so far. The project, Squid Pro Quo, was not only my first attempt at creating a fully functional website with full CRUD functionality using Express, React, and Javascript, but my first attempt at creating something relevant to my favorite hobby. This was also my first time working with Tailwind CSS and its components, which resulted in a sleek and functional UI that I especially like.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
